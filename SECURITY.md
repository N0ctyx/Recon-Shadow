## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Network Exposure**
   - Tool generates network traffic that may be logged
   - DNS queries are visible to DNS servers
   - HTTP requests are logged by target servers

2. **Local File Access**
   - Tool creates local files and reports
   - Temporary files may contain sensitive information
   - Log files may contain target information

3. **Dependencies**
   - Relies on third-party Python packages
   - Network libraries may have their own vulnerabilities
   - System tools (dig, nslookup) are used when available

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Use VPN/Proxy**
   - Route traffic through VPN for privacy
   - Use proxy servers when appropriate
   - Consider Tor for additional anonymity

2. **Secure Storage**
   - Encrypt sensitive reports
   - Use secure file permissions
   - Regularly clean temporary files

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep ReconShadow updated
   - Update Python and dependencies
   - Monitor security advisories
