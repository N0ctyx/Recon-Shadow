### Code Style

- **Follow PEP 8**: Use Python's official style guide
- **Use Type Hints**: Add type hints where appropriate
- **Write Docstrings**: Document all functions and classes
- **Keep Functions Small**: Aim for single responsibility principle

### Example Code Style

```python
def scan_subdomain(subdomain: str, domain: str, timeout: int = 5) -> Optional[Tuple[str, str]]:
    """
    Resolve a subdomain and return the full domain and IP address.
    
    Args:
        subdomain: The subdomain to test (e.g., 'www')
        domain: The base domain (e.g., 'example.com')
        timeout: DNS resolution timeout in seconds
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (full_domain, ip_address) if successful, None otherwise
        
    Raises:
        socket.error: If DNS resolution fails
    """
    try:
        full_domain = f"{subdomain}.{domain}"
        ip = socket.gethostbyname(full_domain)
        return full_domain, ip
    except socket.error:
        return None
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add support for IPv6 DNS resolution"
git commit -m "Fix timeout handling in port scanner"
git commit -m "Update subdomain wordlist with 10 new entries"

# Bad
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "update"
git commit -m "changes"
```

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

```bash
feature/ipv6-support
bugfix/timeout-handling
enhancement/better-reporting
docs/installation-guide
```
